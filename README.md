# üç≥ AI-Powered Recipe Recommender App

This is a **Streamlit-based web app** that recommends recipes based on the ingredients you have. It uses the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch recipes and ranks them using **ingredient-based similarity** powered by **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**.

---

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Search**: Enter the ingredients you have, and the app will find matching recipes.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Recipes are ranked based on how closely their ingredients match your input.
- **Recipe Details**: View detailed instructions, ingredients, and thumbnails for each recipe.
- **Simple and Intuitive**: No complex setup‚Äîjust enter ingredients and get recommendations!

---

## How It Works

1. The app fetches recipes from the **MealDB API** that include the ingredients you provide.
2. It uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert recipe ingredients into numerical vectors.
3. **Cosine similarity** is used to rank recipes based on how closely their ingredients match your input.
4. The top 5 recipes are displayed with their details (ingredients, instructions, and thumbnails).
